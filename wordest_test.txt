welcome  this puzzling problem     currently doing  reaction    where   working with  molecule that contains  moiety shown above   treatment with base carbonate buffer     well    with  there  peaks masses appearing     also  seems like  cleavage   thioester just stagnates after  certain point   took   while  develop ideas what byproducts these masses    could belong     shows  molecule before treatment with base this mass also appears after treatment with base which  find quite confusing because  would expect  thioester   completely broken     shows  molecule upon treatment  thioester  cleaved   thiol  freed  also   mass   disulfide      shows  mass   product without  acetyl protecting group   amine this  something  find super surprising  should  acetyl  cleaved     amide  super stable  know what   about   maybe   just something that happens    through ionization there   extra peak  this mass     molecule  also kinda proves that  really exists   expect   undergo    acyl shift   would obtain  amide   free cysteine shown   they  have  same mass    would   disulfide formed between  free thiol     upon addition     mixture this mass vanished this would also prove    acyl shift theory     there deacetylation happening   first place  nand here comes  biggest question mark  have substrates they  look quite similar   except they   have  acetyl protected amine they   have  amine close  this position   still they  show these weird rearrangement  whatever masses this would speak  another part   molecule participating  these side reactions  structures drawn above  just interpretations   masses based   original molecule    have  other suggestions about what could happen  there another shift    know  between amides   could  secondary amine participate  this reaction because  secondary amine  also present  every substrate    very confused   outcome  this reaction   ideas  suggestions would  very appreciated

this  really interesting because  didn  really have  problem finding jobs with  chemistry degree   also initially started looking when  testing  super prevalent  they were hiring teams specifically  that   notice when  apply  other jobs like  current    nursing home   environmental science  they  super impressed when   chemistry granted    grad school    undergrad   highly ranked university    trying  figure  what  heck   when  finish this degree      just  ready  graduate    kinda    places have been offering though unsure    been  school  years  some  these numbers

that  okay usually   banned from   altogether when   what happened     think    people including doctors really   know about this neurological long     idea everyone  know doesn  have  fucking clue either they just think  either   recover everybody  know     just been sick    days  they  fine   wasn  until   thrown into this universe from  vaccine that  started talking     true long  people   this thing  fucking terrible   like   stuck  purgatory     doctors really   know about that specific version  long  with numbness  like issues burning skin zaps just crazy crazy stuff   leaves  wishing  fucking died  unfortunately people  still fighting over what kind  treatment     help these people     there experimenting  think nothing seems   concrete    live   state where   rate  very    think  doctors just haven  seen   about  rare    been   long haul clinic  they literally think long  people just have anxiety they  pretty much just   because they look normal

 answer  question   trying    nothing   think  could completely prevent  translation    vaccine after   been injected into  muscle maybe   preloaded  injection site with  translation inhibitor  could prevent    cost  some severe side effects  antisense vaccine administered immediately   same site  reduce  total  that gets translated     prevent  entirely loading   immunosuppressants  prevent immunity developing    would still  translated 
remember that        known risks associated with  vaccine  there  less than your friend seems  believe according   research  quantifiably  lower than  infection  both short  long term   there  always  fact that even healthy people that   have  worry about being  sick  only have gotten really sick  died  some cases  even  they  fight   well they   feel  they  still   carrier  being  carrier they   spread   someone   healthy  worse  could mutate within  host  another variant becomes  thing
