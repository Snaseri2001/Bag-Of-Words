  struggling  understand what  mean 
here   lengthy quote where  rejected that claim  made above    fundamental point  that when  comes  capturing carbon      generated doesn  affect  energy required  capture     said this   rejected this claim   following    mean  amount  energy required   uptake   from  atmosphere   relation   energy that  spent  releasing  mixing   into  atmosphere then   very simply wrong about this       implementation   process  made  natural   absolutely  case that when     into  atmosphere energy  spent   that   taken back energy  spent again   amount  this uptake  necessarily  least  much    first mixing  practice     more this  very straightforward thermodynamics       perpetual motion machine  impossible      mislead   letting  early    that this relation between  energies  somehow  when     example when  burn   depending  your furnace  only about   energy released   burn goes into heating  exhaust flue   thereby  component   issue with entropy that  fart  originally about     impression that does then    mistake however  energetics  thermodynamics  releasing that exhaust into  atmosphere  still such that   confidently  would have    least  energy equivalent  that  burning  original     exhaust back     your quote     feel like reading   this  would encourage   just think about what     very   this comment regarding    seem  think  understand  thermodynamics   situation better than published experts  this field whose views  have explicitly cited   argument    above  pretty clearly said that  thought that  amount   energy gained  relevant  determining  thermodynamic feasibility      seem   claiming that instead  were just hoping  estimate  amount  energy that would  required  capture  carbon    also  useful   estimate   much energy would  required even   just  happens   close   assume    emissions were  natural   there   reason  assume  emissions  from natural   blog post that  sent does  care   about  source  that   been trying  argue  that  energy gained from   source does  matter  seems like maybe   agree with this claim  perhaps  agreed with   along   assess  thermodynamic feasibility  carbon capture  have  have  carry   pretty involved modeling   capture process  such model will make assumptions which other experts     agree with which   there   range  estimates   energy cost   made especially difficult  estimate because    actually know what  efficiency  future technology will    estimate that relies  taking some thermodynamic limiting case  then estimating  energy expenditure   real life material  guessing some efficiency   percentage   thermodynamic limiting case will  highly dependent  what someone guesses   efficiency   mentioned above  direct  capture article that  referred   mentions   typical efficiency range   from depending   efficient researchers  able  make  material  could   being energetically worthwhile there   thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will   much energy  make  worthwhile again  wonder     insistent that   wrong about this  this point   summarized several journal articles about carbon capture  they agree with what   saying that carbon capture review article  what gave   impression  were incorrect   first place  read   long time     thing     that   random  whose background  know nothing about  wrong     that    sure  understand carbon capture better than experts   field that   cited    when  said this  confused   your initial claim that thermodynamics limits    point where  couldn   feasible  matter  efficient      where   said that   impossible instead  unfeasible  pretty please shut  intentional misrepresentation   civil    post where  quoted   said  claim that  couldn   feasible  matter  efficient    then  tell   shut   saying that  said that   imposible instead  unfeasible   very confused  what caused your aggressive response      tell   this part where  quoted    saying that  claimed   unfeasible   think that when  said couldn   feasible this  meant   synonymous with impossible rather than unfeasible then either   misread what  wrote   wrote  poorly  either case    trying  intentionally misrepresent what  said  apologize   came  like that    also sort  surprised  your hostile tone here   clarify what  meant  hopefully   both agree  this point which  different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits    point where  couldn   feasible  matter  efficient   what   trying    that  impression  what  have been saying  something like thermodynamics limits  energy efficiency  carbon capture    that  matter  efficient carbon capture technology   would   energetically feasible because  minimum energy required  capture carbon would   high  make  worthwhile   clear that   possible  people  capture  from   since there  already plants that  this what  meant regarding  possibility  feasibility      with whether    energy cost would render direct  capture  practical   reduce  amount     atmosphere  think that practical  likely  better word than possible  feasible  whatever else   probably expressed what   saying   unclear    hope from context   clear what  meant   what  wrote expressed  sentiment that   trying  convey poorly  were rather ungenerous    assuming that   trying   words  your mouth   rhetorical trick    argument   discussion like this   obviously important  both people  understand what  other person  saying

   there flow chemistry   head fuck     system then    system people talk about  being  revolutionary    chemistry however  this point after using  reactor   while  seems just    tool  generate lots  data fast     talk   chemical engineer they call their flow reactors reactors

thanks   response well   tell   handlebar axis  rotation  tilted towards     completely vertical   ground will confirm later what  physically experienced however  that while cycling without hands    move  handlebar does  rotate   bike tilts right with excess weight  left handlebar  tilts right quite   that  have  consciously counterbalance towards  left towards  side where  hanged  weight   handlebar   that agree with your explanation seems   like  actual observation    contrary   second scenario  your answer  bike tilts right   have  counterbalance  tilting  body left   tilted right away from  excess weight   certain   crash  bike
