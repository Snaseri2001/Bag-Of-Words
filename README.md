# Bag-Of-Words
One of the projects that I have done is BOW. In this project, there are comments from users on the Reddit site which are labeled as "Biology", "Chemistry", and "Physics". In the first phase, I implemented an [essay](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Bag-Of-Words/blob/main/1081158.pdf) which presents a clustering method. This essay is implemented in [URL](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Bag-Of-Words/blob/main/Clustering.py). <br>
In order to improve the classification of the comments, we use the word2vec model designed by Google to vectorize the words.
Firstly, I preprocess the comments and select the valuable words for each comment. This is followed by clustering the chosen words into 20 clusters using the KMeans method. We consider 20 variables for each comment, where each variable is associated with a certain cluster. The number of words related to the i-th cluster is assigned to the i-th variable. Therefore, we now have 20 variables for each comment, which motivates us to use a variety of machine learning methods, such as neural networks. The codes are available [here](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Bag-Of-Words/blob/main/BOW.ipynb).
