# Bag-Of-Words
One of the projcect that I have done is BOW. In this project there are comments of users from Reddit site which are labeled by "Biology", "Chemestry" and "Physics".
In the first phase I have implemented an [essay](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Bag-Of-Words/blob/main/1081158.pdf) which presents a clustring method. This essay implemente in this [URL](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Bag-Of-Words/blob/main/Clustering.py). <br>
In order to  improve the classification of the comments we use word2vec model which is designed by google so as to vectrize the words. Firstly I preprocess the comments and choose the valuable words for each comment. It is followed by clustering the choosen words  into 20 clusters with KMeans method. We consider 20 variable for each comment and each vaiable is related to a certain cluster. We assign the number of words which are related to i'th cluster to i'th variable. So, now we have 20 vaiable for each comment and it is motivated us to use a variet of machine learning methods such as neural network. The codes are [here](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Bag-Of-Words/blob/main/BOW.ipynb).
